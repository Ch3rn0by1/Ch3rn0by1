Hello, My name is Ch3rn0by1. I am a Middle schooler in VA, and I love coding but I'm not very good at it. I found github through friends and trying to find
code for my own projects, and I thought it would be fun to try to join and do more stuff! 

Here's some stuff to know about me:

You can contact me at: April26-1986@hotmail.com 
I love to collaborate, but I'm still learning and not very good at coding.
